## Not Our Bug

### JP subtitle freeze

**Source:** Upstream Issue #2 — [MPV unresponsive when video includes JP subtitles](https://github.com/JohnGlaus/Jellyfin_mpv_play/issues/2) (closed)

MPV freezes when playing videos with Japanese subtitles. This is an MPV issue, not a shim issue. The shim doesn't touch subtitle rendering — it only passes the subtitle track to MPV via `sid`. Possible causes include CJK font rendering, ASS/SSA format handling, or missing fonts on the user's system. Not reproducible as a shim bug.

## Not Adding (Duplicate or Low Value)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Queue persistence | Complexity outweighs value — queue is ephemeral, playback position is already saved |
| Sync position from server | Moderate effort, could be annoying — Jellyfin already sends resume position in play commands |
| MPV config detection | Low value — user's mpv.conf is their responsibility, shim already overrides key settings |
| Chapter markers | MPV handles this natively — chapters shown on seekbar, navigation via PgUp/PgDn |
| Audio language preference | Jellyfin handles this natively — user settings in Jellyfin control default audio/subtitle languages |
| Subtitle language preference | Jellyfin handles this natively — same as above |
| Resume confirmation | Jellyfin handles this natively — web UI shows "Resume from X?" dialog before sending play command |
| Quality selection | Requires transcode API integration — not supported |
| Shader profiles | Requires shader management — not supported |

## Ideas (Low Priority)

- **Multi-server support** — Connect to multiple Jellyfin servers simultaneously (partially addressed by multi-config support)
- **Trakt integration** — Scrobble to Trakt.tv
